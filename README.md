# future-mvt
This is a place for all of us to figure out what the next MVT spec should look like. All content is CC0.

Once we establish and agree on our goals, we will work with tile generation, processing, and consuming stacks to see if the changes can be adapted. Once we have a wide-enough following and implementation support, we could even work on standardization.
